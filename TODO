HOT, a Higher-Order Termination prover
See the COPYRIGHTS and LICENSE files.

- consider symbols with arity? in TPDB/TRS/Mixed_HO_10/curry:
  x a -> f(a) terminates but x a -> f a does not...

- express every thing as a big SMT problem?

- replace rhs abstractions by defined function symbols?

- add position to identifiers for error messages (undeclared identifiers)

DONE:

- optimize system calls: can constraints for detecting non size increasing
   functions can be gathered in one system call?
   + memorize types and solutions for each rule?
  constraints are now gathered by equivalence class of functions

- detect variables that must be set to Inf

- gather variable declarations with the same type

- output XTC in non-curryfied form also

- change XTC identifiers in order to get valid HOT identifiers

- add comments into example hot files

- remove from lib the things moved to Rainbow.util

- fix bug in pattern with deriv.xml

- fix bug in positivity checking in apply.xml

- convert HOT into XTC

- in rainbow, mv things from main to util

- in hot, reuse things from rainbow.util
